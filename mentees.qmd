I enjoy working with students of all ages and make an effort to mentor the next generation each year. I have served as a mentor for 7 students across 8 projects. Learn more about the programs I mentor through below:

- [Defense Associated Graduate Student Innovators (DAGSI) Fellows](https://www.soche.org/programs-and-services/employers/dagsi/): Open to graduate students at DAGSI-elgible Ohio institutions of higher education
- [Leadership Experience Growing Apprenticeships Committed to Youth (LEGACY) Program](https://wpafbstem.com/LEGACY/legacy_overview.html): Open to students who have previously attended LEGACY Craftsman camp between 5th and 10th grade
- [Science, Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholars](https://www.smartscholarship.org/smart/en): Scholarship-for-service program open to college students
- [Wright Scholar Research Assistant Program](https://wpafbstem.com/Wright_Scholar/Wright_scholar.html): Open to high school juniors and seniors who will be 16+ years old prior to June 1
