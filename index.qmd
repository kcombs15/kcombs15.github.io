## Hi! I'm Kara Combs!

I am a computer engineer at the Air Force Research Laboratory and a operations research Ph.D. candidate at the Air Force Institute of Technology. My research focuses on improving defense applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) systems through biologically-inspired advancements based on analogical reasoning, neuroscience, and more! I have 20+ peer-reviewed publications and have presented my work at 30+ conferences. I am active in several professional societies and K-12 STEM outreach events.
